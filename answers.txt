1.) I think we are not p_hacking if we later shift to examining instructors only data. 

As professor's comment indicate, instructors may be the subet of users that uses the search engine
more often. Moreover, we are using the same methodology for both users and instructors, we are not 
changing our test methods to reach a significance value. 

We must be careful to make sure we have change our question. 

From     
    Did more users use the search feature? (More precisely: did a different fraction of users have search count > 0?)
    Did users search more often? (More precisely: is the number of searches per user different?) 

To 
    Did more/less instructors use the search feature?
    Did instructors search more/less?

and the answers from the first two cannot apply to the instructors. 


2.) If we run T Test for every pair, we would need to run 21 tests to cover all seven sorting run time
because there are (7,2) possibilities.
